## Problem

With the advent of Covid and the rise of online education the reliance on cloud tools and platforms to conduct class tasks like taking attendance, assignments, and sharing notes, and many tasks are digitalized. Thus as the market need grew a plethora of tools from various sources began to pop up each with its pros and cons. So many students and teachers are beginning to use one or the other. But having a Hotch-potch of tools makes it difficult for a beginner to cope and also there is a learning curve associated with each of these apps.


## Solution

Our solution will consist of an Web application allowing all students, parents, and faculty members to interact with and stay abreast of various academic events.
For students, it will serve as a hub of academic life. They can receive notices, receive and submit assignments, appear for tests, view class-related information or even seek help and discuss academics with classmates.
For the faculty members, deans, and HoDs functionalities will differ. They will have options to assign their respective students, send out notices, display respective class attendances, hold tests, and view student performance.
The application will have features to monitor their ward's performance, interact with faculty and view specifics.
Other than the student-teacher interactive section we will be providing some used to tools needed in student's life like: 
A multilingual intelligent plagiarism checker.
A resume builder
An anti-ragging complaint section
A notification section for Training Placement Cell
A video Conferencing section for classes
Digital library Access section
Smart QR service to be integrated into the smart card which can be used in the library, canteen, gates, etc.
